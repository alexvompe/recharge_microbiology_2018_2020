# recharge_microbiology_2018_2020

  This repository contains R code for the processing and analysis of core coral microbiome data from the Recharge experiment on the north shore of Moorea, French Polynesia from July 2018 - August 2020. Scripts include sequence data pre-processing and quality control in DADA2 and phyloseq, the generation of figure intermediates, and statistical analyses. This repository also contains all data files used in the scripts, with the exception of 'dada2_recharge.R'. Consult 'recharge_micro_all_phyloseqs.R' to generate appropriate phyloseq objects for each analysis. For an explanation of the variables used in this analysis and the context of the study, please see [insert citation here upon publication]. Finally, sequence data used in 'dada2_recharge.R' are publicly available on the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under BioProject accession number PRJNA994532.
